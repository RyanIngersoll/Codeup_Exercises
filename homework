/*1. Create if_homework.php file in your exercise directory.
2. In this file create a variable called $hungry and set it 
to TRUE if you are hungry or FALSE if you are not.
3. Create another variable and call it $food_available and set
 it equal to TRUE or FALSE.
4. Create an if statement that will echo 'We are fed and good to go.' 
if both you have $food_available and are $hungry are true.
5. Now create another variable $have_money and set it to either TRUE 
or FALSE. Adjust your if statement so it reads. If you are $hungry 
and there is $food_available or $have_money then you will eat.
 If none of those are true then echo "Not hungy but thank you!"
